Figure 4.1: Distribution of birth date 4.2 Gender There is a close distribution betwen male and female clients in the bank. Figure 4.2: Gender Distribution 4.3 Number of Dependents Most of the bank’s clients don’t have any depandants on their bank and account and the ones that do, only have one dependant. Figure 4.3: Number of Dependents 4.4 Acount creation by time There was a sharp decrease in accounts created after 1994 and since then ta bank has been recovering from it. Figure 4.4: Distribution of birth date 4.5 Age at account creation The youngest clients that the bank manage to captate are on their late teens when they create their bank account and there is a sharp decrease of account creation after the 60s. Figure 4.5: Distribution of birth date 4.6 Regions There is no concentration of clients in any particular region in the country. Figure 4.6: Clients by Region Looking closely to number of inhabitants in each region and the number of clients we see that there is a major opportunity for improvement in South Moravia.

["loans-1.html", "5 Loans 5.1 Loans Status 5.2 Age distributions of loans 5.3 Loans status by size of loan 5.4 Loans status by monthly payment", " 5 Loans 5.1 Loans Status The bank currently has a healthy record of loans with the majority of loans finished being paid correctly and less then 15% not being paid back. The current loans are also in good state with the majority of those running without problems and aproximatly 10% with the client in debt. Figure 5.1: Loan Satus We can also see that that the number of loans with some problem does not appear to have a growing tendancy, although we can see that there is a decline in loans being issued by the bank showing some room for improvement. Figure 5.2: Loan status by creation date 5.2 Age distributions of loans We can see that the bank spreads its loan through different age groups with the bulk of loans ocurring from the 20s to the late 50s of its costumers and there is no major concentration of bad loans in any age group. Figure 5.3: Loans by birth date By the Bloxplot we can confirm the same conclusions with the addition that loans finished and not payed happened more with slighlty older people than the others. Figure 5.4: Boxplot loans by birth date 5.3 Loans status by size of loan Analayzing the number size of loans taken we can see that bigger loans have higher risks. Comparing the loans finished and the ones still running we can see that in both groups there is ones with problems have a higher median value. Also with we can see that ther is a great number of outliers in the analysis. Figure 5.5: Distribution of birth date 5.4 Loans status by monthly payment The number of outliers preaviusly seen can be explained by the loans with a larger duration, in an analysis of loan size divided by duration we can see that there are no outliers in the boxplot. That analysis also shows that there are more problems in the loans with the higher monthly payment, so focusing on smaller loans could be a better strategy for the company. An interesting insight is that currently there is no default in the loans with a monthly payment smaller then 1.670 so the bank could be more agressive on those loans.

["transactions-1.html", "6 Transactions 6.1 Amount of transactions anually 6.2 Net transactions amount annualy 6.3 Net transactions amount monthly", " 6 Transactions 6.1 Amount of transactions anually The amount of transactions done by the bank is growing continuosly, showing the bank’s growth. The majority of those transactions involves physical cash, either withdrawal or credit, and those are the most important drivers in the transaction’s growth. The share of credit card in the banks transactions is very small. Figure 6.1: Amount of transactions anually 6.2 Net transactions amount annualy We can see that in every year on the time series the net flow of transactions is positive, wich indicates that the bank shouldn’t have a liquidity problem. Figure 6.2: Net transactions amount annualy 6.3 Net transactions amount monthly If we take a closer look to the transactions monthly, we can that on every January and June of every year there is a negative flow of transactions, specially on January. Those negative flows should be a cause for concern to the bank and it should be more cautious on those months. Figure 6.3: Net transactions amount monthly Looking in the types of transactions we can see that the nagative cash flow is caused by a surge in the number of withdrawals. Figure 6.4: Cash Flow Year by Year From the products categorized by the bank we can see that household has the fastest growth, even though it and the other products are going through a period of stagnation recently.

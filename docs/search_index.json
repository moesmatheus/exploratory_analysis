In each file, some columns had to be translated and some data reordered to facilitate the exploratory analysis work. data 2.1 Accounts Here we find the account data. There are 4500 records, each containing information about the account district, frequency of statement issuance, and date of account creation. To make the data easier to understand, we translate Czech frequency values into English and separate dates with hyphens. Table 2.1: accounts frame account_id district_id frequency date 576 55 monthly 1993-01-01 3818 74 monthly 1993-01-01 704 55 monthly 1993-01-01 2378 16 monthly 1993-01-01 2632 24 monthly 1993-01-02 1972 77 monthly 1993-01-02 1539 1 after transaction 1993-01-03 793 47 monthly 1993-01-03 2484 74 monthly 1993-01-03 1695 76 monthly 1993-01-03 2.2 Clients The Clients list contains 5369 bank customers, tabulated with the district code and their birthday code - which informs the birthday and gender. For the analysis, we separated the date of birth and gender in separate columns. Table 2.2: clients frame client_id birth_number district_id gender_code gender birth_date 1 706213 18 1 W 1970-12-13 2 450204 1 0 M 1945-02-04 3 406009 1 1 W 1940-10-09 4 561201 5 0 M 1956-12-01 5 605703 5 1 W 1960-07-03 6 190922 12 0 M 1919-09-22 7 290125 15 0 M 1929-01-25 8 385221 51 1 W 1938-02-21 9 351016 60 0 M 1935-10-16 10 430501 57 0 M 1943-05-01 2.3 Disposition The Disposition relationship contains interactions between customers and accounts, classifying as owner / dependent. Some explanations of possible account-owner-dependency interactions: Every account has an owner and may or may not have dependents. Dependents may own another account. A customer may own more than one account. Table 2.3: disposition frame disp_id client_id account_id type 1 1 1 OWNER 2 2 2 OWNER 3 3 2 DISPONENT 4 4 3 OWNER 5 5 3 DISPONENT 6 6 4 OWNER 7 7 5 OWNER 8 8 6 OWNER 9 9 7 OWNER 10 10 8 OWNER 2.4 Order List of payment orders issued to accounts. In addition to the money order code and the account code, the records contain information about the bank and account you received, the amount and type of payment (household, insurance, leasing and loan). To make it easier to understand, it was necessary to translate Czech payment types into English.

Each customer can only receive one loan. In the table we have Loan key Account Key Date Value Duration (in months) Installment Payment Amount Status (finished - ok; Finished - not ok; Running - ok; Running - in debt) To make understanding easier during the analysis, we classify the status according to its conditions rather than leaving the original groups A through D from the database.

["join-frames.html", "3 Join Frames 3.1 Join frames without transactions: 3.2 Join frames with transactions:", " 3 Join Frames In order to explore our database, we decided to combine the different tables. This was a two-step process: Aggregate every table but the transactions in wich the granularity was the account, the clients were agregated to show only the account owner and the number of the dependants in the account. Next step was to join this new table with Transactions, creating a big dataset with all the data. The granularity for this is the single transaction. With this two new structures we were able to study the data and draw some ideas and conclusions to help the manager. 3.1 Join frames without transactions: #Base frame accounts frame_no_transaction &lt;- account %&gt;% #Join accounts left_join(loan, by = &#39;account_id&#39;) %&gt;% #Join Demographic left_join(demographic, by = &#39;district_id&#39;) %&gt;% #Join disposition left_join( dplyr::filter(disposition, type == &#39;OWNER&#39; ) %&gt;% left_join(disposition %&gt;% group_by(account_id) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(dependants = n()-1), by = &#39;account_id&#39;) , by = &#39;account_id&#39;) %&gt;% #Join client left_join(client,by = &#39;client_id&#39;) %&gt;% #Join card left_join(card, by = &#39;disp_id&#39;) %&gt;% #Join order left_join(order, by = &#39;account_id&#39;) %&gt;% #Join transactions left_join( transaction %&gt;% group_by(account_id) %&gt;% dplyr::summarise(amount_transactions = sum(amount)), by = &#39;account_id&#39;) 3.2 Join frames with transactions: # Join previus frame with transactionns frame &lt;- transaction %&gt;% left_join(frame_no_transaction, by = &#39;account_id&#39;) "],
["client-profile.html", "4 Client Profile 4.1 Birth Date 4.2 Gender 4.3 Number of Dependents 4.4 Acount creation by time 4.5 Age at account creation 4.6 Regions 4.7 Frequency of statements", " 4 Client Profile Understanding who the customer is is a critical step in generating hypotheses and moving on with the analysis. To do this, we explored the data and found some interesting information shared below: 4.1 Birth Date The majority of the bank’s clients were born after the 40s. Figure 4.1: Distribution of birth date 4.2 Gender There is a close distribution betwen male and female clients in the bank. Figure 4.2: Gender Distribution 4.3 Number of Dependents Most of the bank’s clients don’t have any depandants on their bank and account and the ones that do, only have one dependant. If having dependents is a revenue stream of the bank, this should be taken into consideration as an opportunity to grow. Figure 4.3: Number of Dependents 4.4 Acount creation by time There was a sharp decrease in accounts created after 1994 and since then the bank has been recovering from it. Recommendation: investigate the root causes on this decrease, this way the bank can become aware of what impacts it’s business. Figure 4.4: Distribution of birth date 4.5 Age at account creation The youngest clients that the bank manage to captate are on their late teens when they create their bank account and there is a sharp decrease of account creation after the 60s. Having young clients is great for the business in the long term, but they are usually not as profitable as older clients (who already have higher incomes and do more bank transactions). It is suggested to seek greater penetration in the elderly market. Figure 4.5: Distribution of birth date 4.6 Regions There is no concentration of clients in any particular region in the country. Given this scenario, a possible strategy would be to focus on some more profitable regions and gain space in them, then expand and gain more customers in all regions. Figure 4.6: Clients by Region Looking closely to number of inhabitants in each region and the number of clients we see that there is a major opportunity for improvement in South Moravia. Figure 4.7: Clients by Region 4.7 Frequency of statements Almost all clients prefer to have their bank statements sent to them monthly. Figure 4.8: Frequency of statements No bank client born before the 30s choosed to have its bank statement sent after transaction or weekly. Figure 4.9: Frequency of statements "],
["loans-1.html", "5 Loans 5.1 Loans Status 5.2 Age distributions of loans 5.3 Loans status by size of loan 5.4 Loans status by monthly payment", " 5 Loans Loans are a great source of revenue for the bank, so we look at data for opportunities and outlier patterns. 5.1 Loans Status The bank currently has a healthy record of loans with the majority of loans finished being paid correctly and less then 15% not being paid back. The current loans are also in good state with the majority of those running without problems and aproximatly 10% with the client in debt. As the numbers indicate that the credit division is doing well in selecting their clients, it is suggested to extend the possibility of extending this lending to clients with similar profiles to borrowers. Accordingly, we may increase our profits from the volume of such interest. Figure 5.1: Loan Satus We can also see that that the number of loans with some problem does not appear to have a growing tendancy, although we can see that there is a decline in loans being issued by the bank in 1998 showing some room for improvement. Also in 1997 there was a great number of bad loans, problaby being the caus for the reduction of loans in 1998. Figure 5.2: Loan status by creation date 5.2 Age distributions of loans We can see that the bank spreads its loan through different age groups with the bulk of loans ocurring from the 20s to the late 50s of its costumers and there is no major concentration of bad loans in any age group. Figure 5.3: Loans by birth date By the Bloxplot we can confirm the same conclusions with the addition that loans finished and not payed happened more with slighlty older people than the others. Figure 5.4: Boxplot loans by birth date 5.3 Loans status by size of loan Analyzing the number size of loans taken we can see that bigger loans have higher risks. Comparing the loans finished and the ones still running we can see that in both groups there is ones with problems have a higher median value. Also with we can see that ther is a great number of outliers in the analysis. By this information, is suggested to focus on bigger volumes of small loans, so the bank can make profit from it with less risk. Figure 5.5: Distribution of birth date 5.4 Loans status by monthly payment The number of outliers preaviously seen can be explained by the loans with a larger duration, in an analysis of loan size divided by duration we can see that there are no outliers in the boxplot. That analysis also shows that there are more problems in the loans with the higher monthly payment, so focusing on smaller loans could be a better strategy for the company. An interesting insight is that currently there is no default in the loans with a monthly payment smaller then 1.670 so the bank could be more agressive on those loans. Figure 5.6: Loans status by monthly payment "],
["transactions-1.html", "6 Transactions 6.1 Amount of transactions anually 6.2 Net transactions amount annualy 6.3 Net transactions amount monthly", " 6 Transactions 6.1 Amount of transactions anually The amount of transactions done by the bank is growing continuosly, showing the bank’s growth. The majority of those transactions involves physical cash, either withdrawal or credit, and those are the most important drivers in the transaction’s growth. The share of credit card in the banks transactions is very small. This indicates an opportunity of growth from offering more credit cards and making incentives for the clients to use them. Figure 6.1: Amount of transactions anually 6.2 Net transactions amount annualy We can see that in every year on the time series the net flow of transactions is positive, wich indicates that the bank shouldn’t have a liquidity problem. Figure 6.2: Net transactions amount annualy 6.3 Net transactions amount monthly If we take a closer look to the transactions monthly, we can that on every January and June of every year there is a negative flow of transactions, specially on January. Those negative flows should be a cause for concern to the bank and it should be more cautious on those months. Figure 6.3: Net transactions amount monthly Looking in the types of transactions we can see that the nagative cash flow is caused by a surge in the number of withdrawals. Figure 6.4: Cash Flow Year by Year From the products categorized by the bank we can see that household has the fastest growth, even though it and the other products are going through a period of stagnation recently. Figure 6.5: Cash Flow Year by Year "],
["orders.html", "7 Orders 7.1 Order types", " 7 Orders 7.1 Order types From the orders segmented by the bank household stands out as the most relevant one. Creating special deals for this type of order may be a good opportunity for growing the bank but it’s important to analyse if there’s still a tendency in this direction. The risk is that this order type was very significant in the last years due to the economic situation of the country (from socialism to capitalism) and maybe from now on other order types will become more relevant for the population. Figure 7.1: Payment Type "],
["cards.html", "8 Cards 8.1 Card type 8.2 Card type issued by year 8.3 Credit card transactions by type 8.4 Credit card transactions by type 8.5 Credit card transactions by month 8.6 Amount of card transactions by account", " 8 Cards 8.1 Card type The majority of the cards issued by the bank are of the classic type. Since credit cards are not yet widely used by customers, offering premium cards can be a good opportunity to encourage their use. Figure 8.1: Card Type 8.2 Card type issued by year There has been an increse in the number of cards issued by the bank pushed mostly by the classic card. Figure 8.2: Cards issued by date 8.3 Credit card transactions by type The growth in the number of credit cards has also been acompanied by a grow in the number of transactions done by credit card, mostly in the classic card. Figure 8.3: Amount of transactions by card type 8.4 Credit card transactions by type The growth in the number of credit cards has also been acompanied by a grow in the number of transactions done by credit card, mostly in the classic card. Figure 8.4: Amount of transactions by card type 8.5 Credit card transactions by month As it happends with the amount of transactions there is also a spike in the use of credit cards every year in January, especially amongst the users of the classic card. Figure 8.5: Amount of transactions by month 8.6 Amount of card transactions by account The gold card has a slightly higher volume of transactions per client then the other cards. Looking at the clients with the classic card we see that there is a great number of outliers regarding the total of transactions with the card, those clients could be updated to the gold card. Figure 8.6: Amount of card transactions by account "],
["conclusion.html", "9 Conclusion", " 9 Conclusion The bank has seen growth in customer numbers but there is plenty of room to grow. There is still little penetration in the different regions of the Czech Republic and the economic climate is very conducive to winning more customers. Recommendation: Focus on growth first in South Moravia, where population density is high and the bank does not have many clients yet. Focusing on growth in these regions, we can then expand to the rest of the country. Risks: It is important to keep in mind the possible risks of losing room for competitors in other regions. The bank has a good repayment rate for loans made, especially those with lower values. Recommendation: Increase the volume of micro credits, which are performing well and may attract more customers to the bank. Risks: As we increase the volume, we increase our default risk, so we need to work directly with the credit bureau to ensure good customer reviews before lending. A critical point noticed in the analysis is the large amount of withdrawals in July and January, leaving the bank balance negative. It is essential that the bank understands the motivations of customers in these months, to anticipate and not suffer in these months. Recommendation: Conduct qualitative customer research to understand this movement. Based on this, structure action paths to minimize impacts. Risks: Customers may feel overrun when asked about their movements, so it is important to drive carefully to avoid dissatisfaction with the bank. Finally, we see a growth in the number of cards issued in recent years, but still with little movement from them. Recommendation: Create more incentives for credit card use. This can be done by offering more premium cards and ensuring more credit per user. Risks: Because credit cards are not yet part of the Czech Republic’s culture, we may have a period of learning how to use the card, which may cause delinquent invoices. As next steps, we suggest further analysis and exploration of the above points. "]
